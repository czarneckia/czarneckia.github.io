Here, I'll talk about how I like to code. I like to code usually at night, it's hard for me to focus in the day when there's so many other things I could be doing. I like writing pseudocode first, but not for the entire thing. I like to try to test things and figure them out as I go. I always listen to music while I code, usually punk, rock, or metal. If it's upbeat and/or there's screaming, it helps me focus. I also like to take a lot of breaks while coding because I get headaches from staring at the screen a lot. I have a bad habit of procrastinating my code, so sometimes I can't finish debugging it in time. I'm working on that, though. I like using comments in my code, but don't likem to put spaces between everything.
